Section 1: Introduction

1.1 - What is Odamex?

Odamex is a modification of DOOM to allow players to compete with each other
over the internet using the client/server architecture. Thanks to the source
code release of DOOM by id Software in December 1997, there have been many
modifcations that enhanced DOOM in various ways. These modifications are known
as "source ports", as early modifications mainly ported DOOM to other platforms
and operating systems such as Windows and Macintosh.

Odamex is based on the CSDoom 0.62 source code originally created by Sergey 
Makovkin, which is based on the ZDoom 1.22 source code created by Randy Heit.

Odamex is released under the GNU General Public License v2. Please read 
LICENSES for further details regarding the license.


1.2 - Features at a Glance

Odamex features:

 * The popular ZDoom 1.22 core engine and CSDoom 0.62 core netcode
 * Compatability with many major operating systems, including Windows, Linux,
   FreeBSD and Mac OSX
 * Core gameplay modeled on the original doom2.exe
 * Streamlined WAD loading, allowing the server and clients to load WAD files
   on the fly without needing to restart the client or server
 * Compatability with Boom, MBF and CTF Standard maps
 * Deathmatch, Cooperative, Team Deathmatch and CTF gametypes
 * Jumping, Mouselook and other non-standard features available as server-side
   options
 * Comprehensive cheat and exploit countermeasures
 * An open source code base licensed under the GPL, available for anyone to
   examine, compile, or modify to their liking

For Windows, you will need Microsoft Visual C++ 6 or later with nasm
(http://nasm.sourceforge.net/), or MingW32 (http://mingw.org/) with MSYS,
Codeblocks (http://codeblocks.org/) or any other program that can be used to
assist compiling Odamex with MingW. There is a Win32 makefile and a Codeblocks
project availble for Odamex compilation.
