JoLauncher - A java launcher by AlexMax

This is the location of the launcher.  It is not yet integrated into
the makefile.  In order to compile this program, you need the latest
Java JDK from http://java.sun.com.  Once you have it, switch to the src
subdirectory, make sure your classpaths are set to the current dir
(should be an environemt variable, google it, if you're using linux
it's probably already set up correclty) and then type 'javac
JoLauncher.java'.  To run, type 'java JoLauncher'.  One of these days,
I'll make it easier.

This launcher has been compiled with Java 1.5.0_06.  Unless I forsee
some gigantic new feature of Java that makes upgrading necissary, I
will attempt to maintain backwards compatability with earlier versions
of Java as far back as feasibly possible.

Earliest tested versions
------------------------
Windows: 1.5.0_06
Linux: 1.5.0_06
OS-X:	1.4.2_09

This is still alpha quality software, so you are using this at your own
risk, though it's unlikely anything bad will happen.

================
- refresh now lists servers and ports in console
- modified basic structure of GUI, now much nicer
- added a server packet class, doesn't do much yet, and isn't called
  by anything yet
- reworked parser so every action goes through the console parser, this
  centralizes all possible actions in the program and ensures that
	you can access every action in the program from the console
- implimented basic multithreading, now the GUI doesn't lock up when
  you update or refresh
- changed methodology, refresh is now split into two pieces
  + update - updates the master server, also refresh
	+ refresh - parses the list of servers
- updated master packet class, now it's possible to tell if it has been
  run at all to prevent refreh without initial update
- added a working toolbar, with tooltips
- finally started serious work on server packet class, at this point
  it can handshake and return the server name
- new command refresh <hostname>:<port> added
- refresh without arguments now simply feeds the master server list
  to refresh <hostname>:<port>
- bugfix: fixed the loop that parses the asciiz string in the server
  packets, was comparing a byte to a java.lang.Byte, now compares
	byte to byte.
- finally implimented a working JTable, user editing is disabled,
  impliments an append and clear operation so far, and parses the
	two parts of the server packet that the server packet returns so
	far
- refreshing an individual server now fully works in tandem with the
  JTable, preventing duplicates
	+ if a refreshed server is found on the JTable, the entry itself
	  is modified
	+ if a server that's on the JTable doesn't refresh properly, the
	  entry is deleted
- modified console code to something more multithreading friendly,
  this removes prefixes and suffixes, since they don't work as intended
	when multiple items are being searched at once
- added an asciiz praser to the server packet class, it takes in a
  the first index of the string and outputs the length of it
- now you can only select one server on the server table at a time
- implimented REFRESH_ONE action on the GUI actionListener, it takes
  the currently selected server and parses a refresh command on it
- bugfix: sanity check put on REFRESH_ONE to ensure that you're
  actually selecting something
- finally did more work on server packet class, it now returns number
  of players and maxclients for a server
- bugfix: fixed a major bug in my table row updating routine, it was
  only updating the first cell of the row, now it updates the entire
	row
- more work on server packet class, added map name and also ping
- known bug: my launcher can't seem to connect to denis' server for
  some reason, even though servers.php sees it just fine, the launcher
	times out while waitinf for a response
- not a bug: turns out that I can't connect to denis' machine manually
  either, don't know what's up on his end
- bugfix: compatability fix for the GUI table row rewriting function,
          now no more ints are trying to be packed in an object array
- bugfix: fixed up the fact that pings were not getting refreshed
- added the rest of the server packet implimentation, now the program
  is fully functional as a rudamentary server browser
- added a rudamentary config file
  + there should be only one entry in it, the location of the odamex
	  executable
	+ if you are running windows and odamex won't start, try putting
	  double backslashes in your config file
- server connectivity is now implimented and fully functional
