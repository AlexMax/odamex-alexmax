/**
 * An Event Register.
 *
 * Parent class for all classes that will have Agar event callback member 
 * functions.
 *
 * Handling Agar events in ag-odalaunch:
 *
 * Any Agar-based window/dialog that will register events with Agar needs to 
 * inherit from the ODA_EventRegister class.
 *
 * A pointer to the EventReceiver function needs to be provided to Agar as the 
 * event callback function for any event that will call a class member function.
 *
 * The Agar event must receive a pointer to an EventHandler returned from the
 * RegisterEventHandler() function. This function receives the class member 
 * function that should be triggered by the event. When passing the function 
 * ptr cast to EVENT_FUNC_PTR.  Any additional desired variables can be provided 
 * to the event after the required pointer. 
 *
 * The reason for this is that Agar is C-based and C functions cannot receive a 
 * class member function pointer. It is also illegal to cast a 
 * pointer-to-member-function to (void *) and vice versa.
 *
 * Example:
 *     AG_SetEvent(win, "window-user-resize", EventReceiver, "%p", 
 *         RegisterEventHandler((EVENT_FUNC_PTR)&OurClass::OnWindowResize));
