Odamex TODO List.
-----------------

This file contains a basic list of things Odamex should(not) have, some are 
things that will get done while others are just ideas or enhancements.

In contrast to the bugtracker, this is not a bug list per-say. 
For example, a "hack" is not a bug, but more of a workaround that may or may not
introduce bugs, but it is an attempt to fix a problem.

As the lines between this and the bugtracker are grey, this file exists solely
for ideas/enhancements/rewrites of code etc AND NOT FOR BUGS!

Client:
-------


Server:
-------


Launcher:
---------
* Replace our wxListCtrl derived class with wxDataViewCtrl, this will allow us
to add features and fixes to the launcher alot easier without trying to hack 
around the limitations that wxListCtrl has.
* Finish off work on OdaGet.
* Make the server replacement item in the custom servers dialog, this should
allow a listed or dead server be replaced by the address specified in the custom
servers list.
9) Use wxPersistenceManager for storing object properties (dimensions, position
etc) instead of manually storing them in the configuration file. (only available 
in wx 2.9.0)


Master Server:
--------------


Other:
------
* Implement some form of reliable communication mechanism using our current UDP
system for the launcher, master and server, it must handle out-of-order,
duplicate and dropped packets in some fashion, the idea is to make sure one-off
communication between these crucial components are more reliable than what we
have now. This system must sit between the actual socket code and the new 
launcher protocol which has been implemented in the new_sqp branch on our svn
repo.
* Use a build system to generate Makefiles, something like bakefile may be 
sufficient enough.
* Allow downloading of dehacked files
